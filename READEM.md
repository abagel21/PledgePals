# Pledge Pals
Pledge Pals is a comprehensive platform created during HackMIT designed to revolutionize online interaction and build stronger, selfless relationships. Utilizing the MERN stack, we constructed a full stack social media platform with authentication, a backend server which handles login sessions, “medallion” status, and accounts. Users navigate the website by first making or receiving friend requests, and then exchange favors in the form of medallions. Medallions must be accepted -- Pledge Pals is a voluntary platform. Once accepted, medallions sit in the user’s dashboard until completed. Not only are there the surface level benefits of individuals freely giving to one another or to charitable organizations, but also giving favors has been shown to build stronger relationships -- creating a new, thoroughly positive way to interact and connect on a social media platform.
